Repo with my work done in college related mostly to algorithms, computational models, etc.

## [Mathematica Modules](/mathematica-modules/)
### formal_languages.nb
Processing of Formal Languages (few modules)
### 1D_celular_automata.nb
Unidimensional Celular Automata generator via Wolfram numbers
### celular_automata_recog.nb
Binary Celular Automata generation for language recognition (few modules)
### pSystem.nb
Operation of various P systems without formalization

## [Unity](/Unity/)

[Result](https://simmer.io/@fewNeurons/nihma-power)

Simple Universal Render Pipeline project, ready to be compiled for WebGL.

Done for the Animation and Videogame Design subject when studying at UPV (Universitat Politècnica de València)

## [Spell Suggester - Python project](/spell-suggester/)

- result*_txt are reference and result files to test the correct functioning of the distance methods

- leer_resultados.py and plantilla_generar_resultados.py are used to create and read these text files   

- SAR_*.py files form the SAR project, use "python SAR_Indexer.py --help" and "python SAR_Searcher.py --help"  to learn how to use the program

- plots.ipynb is a jupyter notebook that was used to visually test the creation of the graphs with random numbers

- functions_suggest.py and functions_trie_suggest contain the methods to measure the different distances 

- pruebasTiempo.py can be used to measure and compare the times of the different methods. When executed, it creates the 3 different graphs in pdfs with a given name in the form \<name>_graph[1 | 2 | 3].pdf
During the execution, there is also live feedback given about the state of the execution

- spellsuggest.py contains the SpellSuggester and TrieSpellsuggester classes, which are used in the SAR project to suggest similar words to a search term

- The directory corpora contains excerpts of the quijote.txt file of different size as well as the reference data for the SAR project (Newspaper archives in .json format)

## [Jupyter notebook](/jupyter-notebook.ipynb)
### Branch and Bound Algorithmic Approach for (N-Queens on Weighted Board)
